# No-op merge guard: a PR whose merge result changes nothing must not merge green.
#
# Why: connector#1008 merged as an EMPTY commit. A second PR from the same branch
# opened after #1000 had already landed its content. The three-dot diff (the
# "Files changed" tab) was not empty, but the MERGE RESULT was, because main
# already had the content. `refs/pull/N/merge` is what a `pull_request` run
# checks out: first parent = base tip, second = PR head, so
# `git diff <base parent> HEAD` is exactly what the squash commit would carry.
#
# Inputs (env): GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, PR_HEAD_SHA, PR_BASE_REF, PR_NUMBER,
# PR_CHANGED_FILES (the three-dot count from the event payload; not recomputed,
# since a shallow clone lacks the merge base), GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY.
#
# Warns and passes wherever it cannot tell (no merge ref, stale merge ref, not
# a PR event): a required check that fails on "I could not tell" gets disabled.
